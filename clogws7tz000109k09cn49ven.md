## Git Vocabulary

1. **Bare Repository**
    
    * A repository that doesn‚Äôt have a working directory.
        
2. **Branch**
    
    * An active area of development in Git. The newest commit displays the end of the branch.
        
3. **Blame**
    
    * Refers to the most recent alteration to every line in the file. Displays Author, Revision, and Time.
        
4. **Commit**
    
    * Record of a moment in Git history containing specifications of a changeset.
        
5. **Checkout**
    
    * Process whereby a particular commit is chosen from the repository, and the condition of the file associated with it and the directory tree are reproduced in the working directory.
        
6. **Diff**
    
    * The difference in changes between saved changes or two Commits.
        
7. **Detached Head**
    
    * State in which a specific commit is checked out rather than a branch.
        
8. **Fetch**
    
    * Retrieves the most recent changes in the branch and the local or remote repositories.
        
9. **Hash**
    
    * Unique SHA1 code for each Commit.
        
10. **Head**
    
    * Name of the Commit at the end of a Branch.
        
11. **Fork**
    
    * When you Fork the repository, you can add Commits and add Pull Requests.
        
12. **Index**
    
    * A group of files that hold state information.
        
13. **Merge**
    
    * Includes changes from named commits (from when their histories split from the current branch) into the current branch.
        
14. **Master**
    
    * Git‚Äôs default development Branch.
        
15. **Pull Request**
    
    * Suggests changes to the Master Branch.
        
16. **Repository**
    
    * A group of Commits, Branches, and Tags to identify Commits.
        
17. **Push**
    
    * Pushes new changes once they‚Äôve been committed.
        
18. **Working Tree**
    
    * The directory of files that you are currently working on.
        
19. **Origin**
    
    * Default Upstream Repository.

    ```
    

## Managing Files

1. **List which files are staged, unstaged, and untracked:**
    
    ```bash
    git status
    ```
    
2. **Show history of changes:**
    
    ```bash
    git log
    ```
    
3. **List all commits from all branches:**
    
    ```bash
    git log --all
    ```
    
4. **Compare two branches by showing which commits from the first branch are missing from the second branch:**
    
    ```bash
    git log [branch1]..[branch2]
    ```
    
5. **To see the difference between the last commit and the working directory:**
    
    ```bash
    git diff HEAD
    ```
    
6. **Display the content and metadata of an object (blob, tree, tag, or commit):**
    
    ```bash
    git show [object]
    ```
    
7. **To see the difference between the working directory and the index:**

    ```
    

## Making Changes

1. **Add the current changes of a file to staging:**
    
    ```bash

    git commit -m "[descriptive_message]"
    ```
    

## Rewriting History

1. **Replace the last commit with a combination of the staged changes and the last commit combined:**
    
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
    
2. **Rebase the current branch with the specified base (It can be a branch name, reference to a head, tag, or a commit ID):**
    
    ```bash
    git rebase [base]
    ```
    
3. **Lists changes made to the HEAD of the local repository:**
    
    ```bash
    git reflog
    ```
    

## Undoing Changes

1. **Undo all changes in the specified file/directory by creating a new commit and applying it to the current branch:**
    
    ```bash
    git revert [file/directory]
    ```
    
2. **Unstage the specified file without overwriting changes:**
    
    ```bash
    git reset [file]
    ```
    
3. **Undo all changes that happened after a specified commit:**
    
    ```bash
    git reset [commit]
    ```
    
4. **See which files should be removed from the current directory:**
    
    ```bash
    git clean -n
    ```
    
5. **Remove the unnecessary files in the directory:**
    
    ```bash

    ```
    

## Remote Repositories

1. **Remove the unnecessary files in the directory:**

    git remote add [name] [URL]
    ```
    
2. **Fetch a branch from a remote repository:**
    
    ```bash
    git fetch [remote_repo] [branch]
    ```

    ```bash
    git pull [remote_repo]
    ```
